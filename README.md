# Venom HPLC and qMS Prep
1. Re-suspend the lyophilized venom in LC/MS quality water. For large venom samples, the tube can be flicked to help mix (or a split second vortex; not too long as that could affect the protein).
2. Venom will likely need to be spun down after resuspension to pellet any cellular material. Spinning at 12,000G for 3 minutes will do the trick. For smaller venom samples, a pop-spin would likely work just as well.
3. Quantify the venom using the nanodrop. Although it seems to be more accurate and precise than the Qubit, it is by no means perfect. Therefore, we make sure that our venom concentration falls in the 0.3-2.000 ng/ul range. For most venom samples, this usually requires us to make a dilution of the venom sample after a first nanodrop run. Although getting the sample in this range isnâ€™t completely necessary for HPLC and qMS aliquoting, this range allowed us to be more consistent when we were running large numbers of venom samples for the Crotalus projects. The nanodrop has shown concentration readings with a greater than >50% difference when comparing measurements of the same sample across its range. Therefore, we try to use the same range for all samples.
4. For HPLC, aliquot 15 ug of venom in a total of 50 ul (fill with LC/MS water to total of 50 ul) into a sterile 1.7 mL Eppendorf (or screwcap) tube. This tube will then be turned into Carl. He will pipette the 50 ul into a sample vial that machine used for injection into the column.  
5. Take the HPLC samples to Carl. Carl will just ask for samples names. We usually use a sample name format that looks like this: V0001_CLP0001_Cadam_22Sep20_GN
6. For qMS, aliquot 11 ug of venom into a sterile 1.7 mL Eppendorf (or screwcap) tube and lyophilize (I usually add another 20 ul of water to allow the sample to stay frozen longer when putting it on the lyophilizer). Sample will be turned into Carl as a dried 11 ug aliquot of venom. Carl will perform the trypsin digestion. When digested, it will be hand-delivered to the FSU college of medicine translational science lab.
